-- Skill CRUD

-- name: ListSkillsByWorkspace :many
SELECT * FROM skill

-- name: ListSkillSummariesByWorkspace :many
-- Same as ListSkillsByWorkspace but omits the SKILL.md `content` column. Used
-- by list endpoints (CLI table, web list page) where the body is never read;
-- shipping it everywhere blew up payload size on workspaces with many skills
-- and caused 15s CLI timeouts from high-latency regions (GH multica-ai/multica#2174).

-- name: GetSkillByWorkspaceAndName :one
-- Used by agent-template materialization to implement find-or-create: when a
-- template references a skill by name that already exists in the workspace,
-- reuse the existing skill_id rather than INSERT (which would fail the
-- UNIQUE(workspace_id, name) constraint from migration 008).
